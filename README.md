HANGMAN CODE 
# Hangman Fun! (C++ Edition)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a little Hangman game I whipped up in C++. It's pretty simple, but hopefully, you'll have some fun with it!

Here's what you get:

* **Pick Your Poison (Category):** You can choose from categories like Animals, Countries, Fruits, or Sports. Each one's got a bunch of words to guess.
* **Easy-Peasy Interface:** I tried to make it as clear as possible. You'll see the hangman, the word you're guessing, what letters you've used, and how many tries you've got left.
* **No Messing Around:** It'll tell you if you're typing weird stuff instead of letters. And it'll remind you if you've already tried a letter.
* **Big Win/Lose Messages:** When you're done, you'll get a nice little message telling you how you did.

## How to Play (Compile & Run)

1.  **Make sure you've got a C++ compiler. (g++ is a good one!)**
2.  **Save the code as a `.cpp` file. (Like, `hangman.cpp`.)**
3.  **Open your terminal and type this to compile:**
    ```bash
    g++ hangman.cpp -o hangman
    ```
4.  **Then, run the game:**
    ```bash
    ./hangman
    ```

## What's Cool?

* Lots of word categories, so it doesn't get boring.
* You can see the hangman drawing, which is kinda fun.
* It won't let you break the game with bad inputs.
* Tells you nicely when you win or lose.
